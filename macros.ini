oiw=${oil interval why}We recommend servicing your engine oil every 5000 miles. Synthetic may continue to lubricate the internal engine components past 500 miles. However as the oil ages in accumulates byproducts of the combustion process. These contaminants tend to increase the acidity of the oil. This in turn attacks all of the engine seals, gaskets, and o-rings. In our experience, engines serviced every 5000 miles with top shelf synthetic oil have less oil leaks over time. Changing your engine oil every 5000 miles saves money in the long run.
bfw=${brake fluid why}Brake fluid is hygroscopic, it absorbs moisture from the environment. Traditionally brake fluid was replaced every two years. We use brake fluid test strips as well as electronic moisture meters to determine if and when the brake fluid is due.  We use pass/fail scientific testing methods to ensure that your brake fluid is always ready for the road ahead.
cvtw=${cvt fluid why}CVT transmissions can change seamlessly through its range of gear ratios. CVT transmissions are more fuel efficient that and equivalent automatic transmissions, however they are generally more expensive to rebuild or replace than a traditional automatic transmissions. We recommend servicing most CVTs every 30,000 miles for maximum life.
siw=${service items why}Our service items were hand picked for one reason. To save you money. Our service items contain a lock lubricant from Mercedes to keep your tumblers working for the life of the vehicle. A dry specialty lubricant is used on the window tracks, this has nearly eliminated broken window regulators on vehicles that we normally service. A professional fuel injection service is included, this pulls moisture out of the fuel tank from blended ethanol as well as cleans the injectors and fuel system. Included in this service is an engine flush and an oil additive. The engine flush helps keep the lifters, piston oil rings, and valvetrain clean of oil sludge. The oil additive helps counteract the acidification of the oil and the following oil leaks.
gow=${gear oil why}Gear oils, such as those found in Manual transmissions, transfer cases, and gearboxes should be serviced regularly. Gear oil protects gears, bearings and other very expensive non-maintenance internal parts. Gear oil generally fails from heat, lubricant shearing, and break down of viscosity modifiers. We recommend most gear oils at 60,000 miles. Some vehicles have as little as a 15,000 mile factory service intervals.
cow=${coolant why}Modern coolant protects many dissimilar metals and plastics. We test coolant with scientific pass/fail methods. One of the most overlooked coolant PH. The PH or acidity increased over time. This acidity combined with dissimilar metals in the cooling system, creates a battery. The resulting transfer of electrons can attack your water pump, cylinder heads, head gaskets, heater core, radiator and every other metal component. Changing your coolant when needed is paramount to long component life.
cfw=${cabin filter why}Your vehicle is equipped with a cabin air filter, this filter works like a home HVAC filter. We live in a very humid climate, combined with pollen, mold, and dust this contaminates your cabin filter. A clogged cabin filter may also overheat the blower motor due to lack of airflow.In our experience 15,000 miles or every 18 months is the recommended interval for our area.
afw=${air filter why}Several benefits of changing your car's air filter: better fuel economy, improved acceleration, increased engine life, and overall improved driveability. We normally recommend changing air filters every 15,000 miles in the Willamette valley.
psw=${power steering fluid why}Over time power steering fluid becomes contaminated with bits of worn internal parts, metal, and other contaminants. Flushing out this fluid helps extend the life of the steering rack and pump. These are very expensive components to replace.
spw=${spark plugs why}Over time spark plugs wear. This wear creates a larger and larger gap for the combustion spark to jump. The large gap causes a higher load on the ignition coils or secondary ignition system, which in turn wears them out prematurely. Changing your spark plugs at the specified interval helps avoid costly repairs to the ignition system.
tbw=${timing belt why}The timing belt keeps the engine valves and pistons in time related to each other. If this belt breaks on many engines, the pistons and valves make contact, and the engine suffers catastrophic damage. We generally recommend timing belt and water pump replacement every 105,000 miles or every 7 years, unless the manufacturer specification is a more often replacement.
ssw=${shocks struts why}Shocks and struts are one of the most overlooked safety items on a modern vehicle. Shocks and struts aid in steering stability, short braking distance, and overall handling of your vehicle. Tire and suspension component wear can be greatly accelerated. Worn out shocks and struts can also transmit more road vibrations to the vehicle, these vibrations wear out other components and often cause interior squeaks and rattles.
ffw=${fuel filter why}Ethanol is added to fuel in Oregon. Ethanol is hygroscopic, it pulls in moisture from the atmosphere. This moisture can cause corrosion and hard part failure in the fuel system.  The fuel filter is designed to keep all foreign material out of high pressure fuel pumps and injectors. Both are very expensive components with very tight mechanical tolerances. We generally recommend changing your fuel filter every 60,000 miles.
